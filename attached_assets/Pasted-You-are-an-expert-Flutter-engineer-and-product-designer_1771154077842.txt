You are an expert Flutter engineer and product designer. Build a production-ready Flutter app for a Christian ministry called “Hope in Christ for All Nations Ministries”.

GOAL
A mobile app that helps members and visitors:
1) Watch/listen to sermons and teachings (audio/video)
2) Give/donate securely
3) Register for conferences and events
4) Join interactive chats (community + prayer requests)
Also include a schedule, location, departments, leadership info, and social links.

TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS
- Flutter (latest stable) + Dart
- Clean Architecture (presentation/domain/data) OR simple layered architecture but organized
- State management: Riverpod (preferred) or Provider (choose one and be consistent)
- Routing: go_router
- Networking: dio
- Local storage: shared_preferences for simple settings + cached data
- If backend is needed: use Firebase (Auth + Firestore) for chat + registrations; keep it minimal and simple
- If payments/donations need an integration: implement “donation intent” flow and allow 2 options:
  (A) External link button to PayFast/PayPal/Stripe checkout (configurable)
  (B) Manual EFT details page (admin-configurable)
Do NOT hardcode real keys. Use placeholder config values in one file.

BRANDING
Use official colors:
- Purple, Red, Blue, White, Black
Create a consistent theme:
- Light theme: white background, purple primary, red/blue accents, black text
- Dark theme: near-black background, purple primary, red/blue accents, white text
Use Material 3, modern rounded cards, clean spacing.
App slogan options to include in About screen:
- “Inspiring Hope… Encouraging Life”
- “Winning, Discipling, Imparting and Sending”
